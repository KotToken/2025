Honey, honey - how you thrill me, aha, honey honey
honey, honey - nearly kill me, aha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
and now I know what they mean
you're a love machine
(oh, you make me dizzy)
========================
Honey, honey - let me feel it, aha, honey honey
honey, honey - don't conceal it, aha, honey honey
the way that you kiss goodnight
the way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing
when you do your thing
========================
I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna see you cry
so stay on the ground girl
you better not get too high
but I'm gonna stick to you boy
you'll never get rid of me
there's no other place in this world
where I rather would be
========================
Honey, honey - touch me baby, aha, honey honey
honey, honey - hold me baby, aha, honey honey
you look like a movie star
but I know just who you are
and honey to say the least
you're a doggone beast
========================
So stay on the ground girl
you better not get too high
========================
There's no other place in this world
where I rather would be
========================
Honey, honey - how you thrill me, aha, honey honey
honey, honey - nearly kill me, aha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
and now I know what they mean
you're a love machine
(oh, you make me dizzy)
