Honey, honey - how you thrill me, aha, honey honey
honey, honey - nearly kill me, aha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
and now I know what they mean
you're a love machine
(oh, you make me dizzy)

Honey, honey - let me feel it, aha, honey honey
honey, honey - don't conceal it, aha, honey honey
the way that you kiss goodnight
the way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing
when you do your thing
